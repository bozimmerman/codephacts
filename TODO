Total lines should have overlap for comments and blank lines on line change chart
Contributor models should be based entirely on commits from the contributor, if not already

New chart types to consider:
- Heatmap showing commit activity by day/week/month
- Treemap showing language distribution by file size
- Sankey diagram showing how code flows between different components
- Velocity chart showing rate of code change over time
- Technical debt estimation chart (comment ratio, complexity trends)

Add health score:
$healthScore = (
    ($commentRatio * 0.2) +           // Documentation
    (1 / ($avgComplexity / 10) * 0.3) + // Simplicity
    ($testCoverage * 0.3) +            // Testing (if tracked)
    ($consistencyScore * 0.2)          // Consistency metrics
) * 100;
consistencyScore = (
    namingConventionAdherence +  // % of identifiers following your conventions
    styleGuideAdherence +         // % matching checkstyle/formatter rules
    patternConsistency +          // Similar structures using similar approaches
    documentationUniformity       // All similar elements documented similarly
) / 4
Halstead metrics (effort / difficulty / estimated bugs / time / volume / vocabulary), logical LOC (lloc), object oriented structure metrics
