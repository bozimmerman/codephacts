Date range selector for all charts (not just query page) -- maybe drag click mouse over chart dates to change date range.
Language filter on project page to see only specific languages
Contributor filter (if commit_user data is rich enough)
Branch comparison -- heck, just supporting multiple branches for git!
Batch re-process ability for individual projects/branches

In phactor.php and rules:
2. Add complexity number(s) to the statistics table for every commit
3. Add to each appropriate rule the ability to return complexity number(s) for each file analyzed
4. Add some way to average or sum or otherwise combine complexity number(s) to come with with complexity number(s) for each commit language
5. Go back and add this info to public project page on the summary chart for each language

New chart types to consider:
- Heatmap showing commit activity by day/week/month
- Treemap showing language distribution by file size
- Sankey diagram showing how code flows between different components
- Velocity chart showing rate of code change over time
- Technical debt estimation chart (comment ratio, complexity trends)

Complexity suggestions:
cyclomatic_complexity FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
cognitive_complexity FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
halstead_difficulty FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
halstead_volume FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
maintainability_index FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
max_nesting_depth INT DEFAULT 0,
avg_function_length FLOAT DEFAULT 0
Per commit:
- Average complexity across all files
- Weighted average (by file size)
- Percentile values (p50, p95, p99)
- Max complexity (hotspot identification)
- Complexity density (complexity per KLOC)

Per project:
- Complexity trend over time
- Complexity by language
- Complexity distribution histogram
- Industry standard benchmarks (complexity vs avg project, etc)
- Add project description field


Add health score:
// Calculate overall health score
$healthScore = (
    ($commentRatio * 0.2) +           // Documentation
    (1 / ($avgComplexity / 10) * 0.3) + // Simplicity
    ($testCoverage * 0.3) +            // Testing (if tracked)
    ($consistencyScore * 0.2)          // Consistency metrics
) * 100;
