Milliseconds out of timestamps please
Total lines should have overlap for comments and blank lines on line change chart
Add little project image for overview and project page, and description for project page
Date range selector for all charts (not just query page) -- maybe drag click mouse over chart dates to change date range.
Language filter on project page to see only specific languages
Branch comparison -- heck, just supporting multiple branches for git!

New chart types to consider:
- Heatmap showing commit activity by day/week/month
- Treemap showing language distribution by file size
- Sankey diagram showing how code flows between different components
- Velocity chart showing rate of code change over time
- Technical debt estimation chart (comment ratio, complexity trends)

Add health score:
$healthScore = (
    ($commentRatio * 0.2) +           // Documentation
    (1 / ($avgComplexity / 10) * 0.3) + // Simplicity
    ($testCoverage * 0.3) +            // Testing (if tracked)
    ($consistencyScore * 0.2)          // Consistency metrics
) * 100;
