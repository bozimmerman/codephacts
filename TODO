1. Add SQLLite support (mysql optional)
2. Setup with Caddy 8088 8089 8090 7777 9999



On public project page:
1. All charts graphs should default to Using total lines (see below)
2. All charts graphs labeling to make explicit that total lines is used (not code lines, or lines of code)
3. Create a chart mapping total, code lines, code statements, weighted, etc to their statistics column and proper labels.
4. Make the entire page convertable between the previously created chart (e.g. ability to choose weighted code stats instead of total lines)
5. Conversion in #4 should recalculate stats from new column and convert labels as appropriate from the chart
6. After 1-5, allow the default statistics column used (presently Total Lines) to come from the project table instead of hard coded.
7. Add ability for the user to select from one of the entries in chart (with explanation for each) 3.  Such a selection is saved in cookies.

On public languages page:
1. Same changes as on public project page

Add a Contributors tab doing to contributors what languages does for, well, languages.


On admin projects page:
1. Add default project statistics "lines" column to use for charts graphs in public project and languages pages

In phactor.php and rules:
1. Add a weight factor for every language rule that does not return 1: use for weighted columns in phactor.php by multiplying factor by the appropriate other column.
2. Add complexity number(s) to the statistics table for every commit
3. Add to each appropriate rule the ability to return complexity number(s) for each file analyzed
4. Add some way to average or sum or otherwise combine complexity number(s) to come with with complexity number(s) for each commit language
5. Go back and add this info to public project page on the summary chart for each language

New chart types to consider:
- Heatmap showing commit activity by day/week/month
- Treemap showing language distribution by file size
- Sankey diagram showing how code flows between different components
- Velocity chart showing rate of code change over time
- Technical debt estimation chart (comment ratio, complexity trends)

Date range selector for all charts (not just query page) -- maybe drag click mouse over chart dates to change date range.
Language filter on project page to see only specific languages
Contributor filter (if commit_user data is rich enough)
Branch comparison -- heck, just supporting multiple branches for git!
Batch re-process ability for individual projects/branches

Complexity suggestions:
cyclomatic_complexity FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
cognitive_complexity FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
halstead_difficulty FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
halstead_volume FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
maintainability_index FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
max_nesting_depth INT DEFAULT 0,
avg_function_length FLOAT DEFAULT 0
Per commit:
- Average complexity across all files
- Weighted average (by file size)
- Percentile values (p50, p95, p99)
- Max complexity (hotspot identification)
- Complexity density (complexity per KLOC)

Per project:
- Complexity trend over time
- Complexity by language
- Complexity distribution histogram
- Industry standard benchmarks (complexity vs avg project, etc)
- Add project description field


Add health score:
// Calculate overall health score
$healthScore = (
    ($commentRatio * 0.2) +           // Documentation
    (1 / ($avgComplexity / 10) * 0.3) + // Simplicity
    ($testCoverage * 0.3) +            // Testing (if tracked)
    ($consistencyScore * 0.2)          // Consistency metrics
) * 100;
