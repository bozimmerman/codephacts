Total lines should have overlap for comments and blank lines on line change chart
Project breakdown per contributor (perhaps "project" drop down on contributors page? defaults 'All', but if given, data is limited)
Date range selector for all charts (not just query page) -- maybe drag click mouse over chart dates to change date range.
Language filter on project page to see only specific languages

New chart types to consider:
- Heatmap showing commit activity by day/week/month
- Treemap showing language distribution by file size
- Sankey diagram showing how code flows between different components
- Velocity chart showing rate of code change over time
- Technical debt estimation chart (comment ratio, complexity trends)

Add health score:
$healthScore = (
    ($commentRatio * 0.2) +           // Documentation
    (1 / ($avgComplexity / 10) * 0.3) + // Simplicity
    ($testCoverage * 0.3) +            // Testing (if tracked)
    ($consistencyScore * 0.2)          // Consistency metrics
) * 100;
consistencyScore = (
    namingConventionAdherence +  // % of identifiers following your conventions
    styleGuideAdherence +         // % matching checkstyle/formatter rules
    patternConsistency +          // Similar structures using similar approaches
    documentationUniformity       // All similar elements documented similarly
) / 4
